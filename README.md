Problem Statement 
This project simulates a Smart Vending Machine that allows users to browse 
and purchase products such as beverages, chips, and chocolates. The machine 
automatically sorts product lists, enables efficient search by product name, 
and calculates optimal change using a greedy approach. The real-world context 
is a self-service automated kiosk used in public areas like offices, malls, and 
stations. 
The end-user interacts with the system to: 
• Browse available items by category. 
• Search and select specific products. 
• View the cart and checkout. 
• Insert money and receive change.
